## Welcome to Skiff Mail!

Skiff Mail empowers freer and more effective communication through private, end-to-end encrypted email. All messages sent between Skiff users are end-to-end encrypted. Additionally, Skiff never stores unencrypted access to messages sent or received from external mail providers.

### Documentation and whitepaper
Skiff Mail's technical model is documented in [Skiff's whitepaper](https://skiff.org/whitepaper).

Building and using Skiff Mail locally requires linking Skiff's cryptography and UI libraries, which are open sourced on our organization's GitHub page. Soon, they will be properly included and linked from within this repository.
